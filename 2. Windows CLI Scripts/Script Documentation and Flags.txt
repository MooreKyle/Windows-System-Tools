#                                      INTRODUCTION                                      #
==========================================================================================

There are currently 16 main scripts.
This document provides a brief description of each script’s purpose,
lists the commands used in each one, and includes a short explanation of
what each command does. Scripts that require administrator privileges
or a network connection are clearly marked.

(x2) = Command is run a second time (within script 0 only)
. . . = Command is abbreviated for brevity
(DUPE) = Command exists >1, and in another decimal script (not counting scripts ending in .9)
✅ = Script requires 'Administrator Privileges' to fully execute
📶 = Requires network connection for all commands to fully execute
❌ = Script does not require 'Administrator Privileges'/'Network Connection' to fully execute
❌📶 – Internet optional (script runs offline but benefits from network connection)
